Bad league code that I never bothered fixing. I used this to learn some C++ during freetime

Spellbook was broken because of nullpointer during iteration, Never bothered fixing. 

Rest was prototype code but still ok for learning purposes.

No I will not support this code.

No this account is not really active.

Figure it out yourself
